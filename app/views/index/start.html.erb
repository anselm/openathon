<h1>How it works</h1>
 
<p>
It’s pretty easy. Team Captains start teams and get their friends to join. Captains tell us when the team wants to sing and each team signs up for at least 3 hours work of singing time. Teams commit to raising at least $500 per hour of singing (3 hours = $1,500 goal).
</p>
<p> 
Once the team is formed, your friends can join and ask their friends to help sponsor their teams. All donations are collected and tracked on this site in real time, so everyone can see where they stand. Prizes are awarded to those who raise the most – teams and individuals.
</p>
<p> 
Then, on September 24th, we’ll celebrate our hard work and raise our voices for Ethos and the importance of music education.
